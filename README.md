## App with better tools to use spotify

### Quickstart

you need to be added to the app on my Spotify dev account, without that im pretty sure you cant do anything..
but, if you are, this is how you start the app:

no need to start the server, its running on a web server already..

```
cd ../client
$npm i
$npm run dev
```
