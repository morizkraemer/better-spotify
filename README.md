## App with better tools to use spotify

### Quickstart

you need to be added to my the app on my Spotify dev account, without that im pretty sure you cant do anything..
but, if you are, this is how you start the app:

```
$cd server
$npm i
$npm run dev
$cd ../client
$npm i
$npm run dev
```

there is my spotfiy client ID and secret in the env files, so dont share it ;)
