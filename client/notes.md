# Notes

## Ideas

combining spotify and beatport for searching for music.

### Sidebar

- playlists
- search history / undotree

### discover

- each track has a button to load spotify recommendations and a button to load beatport recommendations as the next discover page
- have to find a good solution to displaying beatport tracks in spotify
- search for labels on beatport, look up tracks on spotify and display

### TODO

- beatport integration
- persistent logins
- implement router
